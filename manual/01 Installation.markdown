<h1 id="section_1">1 Installation</h1>

The Ruby language must be installed, as well as a package manager, such as RubyGems. 
Pakyow plays nice with MRI (1.8.7 and 1.9.2) and JRuby.

Installing Pakyow is super easy:

<code class="console">
  gem install pakyow
</code>

Both pakyow-core and pakyow-presenter will be installed. Now you're ready to rumble.
